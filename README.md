# MVP for Android

Model-View--Presenter patter is more efficient for android development 

MVP separates each and every component such as View, Model and Presenter

View: - It has only logic to update the UI Components

Presenter: - It has business logic such as fetching data from Web Services or Data Bases.

Model: - It a POJO Class which has local data to be updated on View.


Benefits of MVP:-

•	Each and every Component can be run independently without having dependency on other components.

•	Easy for writing unit test cases and UI test cases  

•	Easy to Implement
